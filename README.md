# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System using Remora Optimization

The **Crop Recommendation System** is an intelligent application that recommends the most suitable crop based on soil and environmental parameters such as **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall**.

The system uses a **Machine Learning model optimized with the Remora Optimization Algorithm (ROA)** and is deployed using a **Flask-based web application**. It also supports **IoT-based real-time sensor data integration**.

##  Problem Statement

Farmers often face challenges in selecting the most appropriate crop due to changing soil conditions and climate variability. Traditional methods rely on experience and guesswork, which may result in low productivity.

This project provides a **data-driven crop recommendation system** to improve agricultural decision-making.
